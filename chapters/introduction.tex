\section*{Introduction}
This document seeks to provide the author's original solutions to the exercises posed in the Springer publication ``Graph Theory'' attributed to J.A. Bondy and U.S.R. Murty. This list will be updated as and when the author progresses with the problems aforementioned. Corrections and amendments are welcome. \\

Throughout this document we define, as in the book, $n = |V(G)|$ and $m = |E(G)|$ for some graph $G$. We also assume, within the solution, the parameters already defined in the question.
